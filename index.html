 I tell stories and create campaigns that invite reflection and exploration.
I'm currently a content marketer at <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/">Uniswap Labs</a>, serving its mission to unlock value through universal exchange.
 </p>
<p>Past roles include: (1) Leading SEO & content strategy at <a href="https://thegivingblock.com/">The Giving Block</a>, a crypto philanthropy company that serves donors and nonprofits. (2) Directing communications for <a href="https://www.asymptotejournal.com/">Asymptote Journal</a>, which helps introduce hidden gems of translated literature to the masses. (3) Digital marketing at <a href="https://www.afsusa.org/">AFS Intercultural Programs</a>, a global student exchange program provider. 
</p>
<p>
    Once upon a time I also moonlighted as a playwright. Select works had staged performances, workshops and readings in venues like Littlefield, Theater 80, Jersey City Theater Center, Pete’s Candy Bar, the Cherry Lane Theatre, and The Hive (RIP).
</p>
<p>I'm a graduate of Skidmore College, with a B.A. in English. If you get to know me, you'll find me to be surprisingly lax about Oxford comma usage.

<p>
    I live in Brooklyn, New York, where I enjoy biking over the Gowanus Canal daily.
